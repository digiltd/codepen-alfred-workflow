# CodePen Alfred Workflow

Super simple workflow shortcuts that mainly uses the built in functionality of Alfred with just a hint of AppleScript.

Nothing special, but it is very handy, and I use it all day everyday.

As great as [CodePen](https://www.codepen.io) is, when you are in a pen it is a bit tedious having to click (not hover) your profile icon, then click on Pens to load a page where you then click for the third time to either create a new pen or view your private pens.

**December 2017 update**

- chose to search "including forks" using **cpsf**
- added Dashboard
- Dashboard, Private Pens, Homepage shortcuts now check to see if a Chrome Tab already exists for the target URL before creating a new one. 

## Usage

After install, change the variable `cp_username` in Alfred to your CodePen username (this is just to build the private pen link so it lands on your page)

Trigger your Alfred shortcut and tap...

- `cp` to see list of shortcuts below

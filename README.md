# codepen-alfred-workflow

Super simple workflow shortcuts that mainly uses the built in functionality of Alfred with just a hint of AppleScript.

Nothing special, but it is very handy, and I use it all day everyday.

As great as [CodePen](http://www.codepen.io) is, when you are in a pen it is a bit tedious having to click (not hover) your profile icon, then click on Pens to load a page where you then click for the third time to either create a new pen or view your private pens.

**Updated in April 2016 to allow you to hold ⌘ after tapping `cpn` (codepen new) into Alfred, which opens a new pen in a new window**

View the `raw` version of codepen.alfred-workflow to download, or [click here](https://github.com/digiltd/codepen-alfred-workflow/raw/master/CodePen.alfredworkflow)

After install, trigger your Alfred shortcut and tap...

- `cpn` for a new pen (hold ⌘ to open in new window)
- `cpp` for your private pens 
- `cps` followed by your words to search
- `cp` for the CodePen homepage

Note that by default (as it is my prefered browser) holding `cmd` to open a new pen in a new window will do so in Chrome. The AppleScripts for Safari and Firefox are in the workflow, comment/uncomment them to activate.

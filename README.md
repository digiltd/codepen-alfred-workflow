# codepen-alfred-workflow

Super simple workflow shortcuts that mainly uses the built in functionality of Alfred with just a hint of AppleScript.

Nothing special, but it is very handy, and I use it all day everyday.

As great as [CodePen](https://www.codepen.io) is, when you are in a pen it is a bit tedious having to click (not hover) your profile icon, then click on Pens to load a page where you then click for the third time to either create a new pen or view your private pens.

## December 2017 update

- chose to search "including forks" using **cpsf**
- added Dashboard
- Dashboard, Private Pens, Homepage shortcuts now check to see if a Chrome Tab already exists for the target URL before creating a new one. 


View the `raw` version of codepen.alfred-workflow to download, or [click here](https://github.com/digiltd/codepen-alfred-workflow/raw/master/CodePen.alfredworkflow)

After install, trigger your Alfred shortcut and tap...

- `cpn` for a New Pen
- `cpp` for your Private Pens 
- `cpd` for your Dashboard 
- `cps` followed by your keywords to Search
- `cpsf` followed by your keywords to Search (including forks)
- `cph` for the CodePen Homepage
